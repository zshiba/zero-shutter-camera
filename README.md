# Zero Shutter Camera
Zero Shutter Camera is a native Google Glass application that triggers a camera snapshot at special moments for the wearer by continuously monitoring the wearer's physiological state over a Bluetooth connection.

## Prototype concept and implementation
Zero Shutter Camera is a prototype to show a potential of using wearerâ€™s physiological signals as inputs. (This work was presented at [ACM UIST 2014](http://uist.acm.org/uist2014/).)

### 5. How to receive information
Send information as the defined string format to Glass over Bluetooth connection.

##### How to test Zero Shutter Camera

(on Android device)
1. Unpair a sender device from Glass

(on Glass)  
2. Launch ZeroShutterCamera app  
3. Move to the right live card showing the connected Bluetooth device, which is currently None  
4. Move to the Bluetooth card under the Settings live card  
5. If Glass has already paired an Android device, tap once and choose "Forget"  
6. Tap once on the Bluetooth card, and then select "Android". While Glass is showing the instruction, move to Step. 5

(on Android device)  
7. Launch an app that sends information to Glass  
8. Pair to Glass when a popup window asking to pair to Glass

9. Make sure Glass is showing the same message to pair to the Android device  
10. Make sure Glass is showing the sender device's name and received infromation


### 6. How to take pictures
Zero Shutter Camera will automatically trigger a camera shutter at special moments, based on received information.


### 7. How to stop
